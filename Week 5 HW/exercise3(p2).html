        <h1>What is Web Design?</h1>
        <p>
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.<br>
            It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather<br> than software
            development.
            Web design used to be focused on designing websites<br> for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s,
            design for mobile and tablet<br> browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
